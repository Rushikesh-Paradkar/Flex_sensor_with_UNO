# Flex_sensor_with_UNO
An Arduino project to read and process data from 5 flex sensors, converting their resistance changes into real-time bend angles (0°–90°). Includes per-sensor calibration, a moving average filter for noise reduction, and serial output. Useful for gesture control, robotics, prosthetics, and VR motion tracking applications.
